# grinding

Obsidian vault to help you keep track of the Leetcode problems you've solved, and are willing to solve.

I've organized this vault in such a way that the friction for you to just grab a new problem, analyze it, solve it, and document it, it's the smoothest one possible (given that you've used [Obsidian]() before. Otherwise, would take you some time to get it through the learning curve)

### Root

Here you could find some predefined table views, built with [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/api/intro/) (an Obsidian community plugin), where you could visualize all the problems (Markdown files) within your `/coding` folder

You could show there any property defined in your problem Markdown file. Here is the list of currently supported properties + [Dataviews' Implicit fields](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/annotation/metadata-pages/#implicit-fields):
